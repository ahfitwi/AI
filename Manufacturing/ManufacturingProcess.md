  - Tools & Material Costs
  - Required Levels of Automation
- There six main categories of manufacturing processes, which are:
  - Forming
  - Casting
  - Moulding
  - Joining
  - Machining
  - Additive Manufacturing
- Each one of these categories contains a large number of different manufacturing techniques.

1. **Forming**: Involves applying forces or pressure and plastically deforming the 
    material to produce the desired shape.
  - Typically used for metals
  - Done when the metals are above (Hot working) or below (cold working) their recrystallization temperature.
  - Hot Working: easier to plastically the deform metal.
  - Increase material strength (strain hardening)
  - Types:
    - **Forging**: Done using machines using bottom and top dies that make the metal flow into the shape of the dies
      - Improve mechanical properties
      - Difficult to achieve tight tolerance
      - Equipment can be expensive
    - **Extrusion**:a process where a material undergoes plastic deformation by the application of a 
        force causing that material to flow through an orifice or die. The material adopts the 
        cross-sectional profile of the die and if the material has suitable properties, that 
        shape is retained in the final extrudate.
      - Excellent surface finish
      - can achieve tight mechanical tolerances
      - only suitable for 2D shapes
    - **Rolling**: Involves passing metal between two or more rollers; apply pressure and redduce thickness
      - can result in improved mechanical properties
      - can be fully automated (suitable for large scale production)
      - tight tooling costs
      - cannot produce complex shapes
2. **Casting**: Involves poring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to solidify.
  - A primary shaping process
  - Like Forging, casting is most commonly used for metals
  - Types
    - **Die Casting**
      - Molten metal is forced into reusable metal dies at high pressure.
      - Once the molten metal has solidified, it is removed from mold
      - Mostly used for non-ferrous metal like aluminum and zinc, which have low melting temperatures
      - I provides 
        - An excellent surface finish 
        - can achieve very tight tolerances
        - but high start-up costs
        - suitable for large production runs
    - **Sand Casting**: A pattern is used to create a single-use mold from damp sand
      - The sand is tyoically contained in two mold boxes called the cope and the drag
      - Molten metal is poured intothe sand throug a channel formed in the sand.
      - When the metal has solidified the cast object can be removed from the sand.
      - Sand castling:
        - can be used for a wide range of metals, including those with hgh-melting temperatures
        - can produce large and complex parts, and 
        - intial costs are very low, making it good for small production runs
        - but provides poor surface finish
        - not accurate as other casting processes
    - **Investment Casting**: Several wax pattern of the same object are created and attached to a sprue.
      - The wax tree is dipped into a slurry to create a ceramic mold.
      - Heat is applied to melt out the wax
      - Moolten metal is then poured into the ceramic mold.
      - Once, the casting has cooled the mold is broken off
      - IC:
        - good for parts with complex geometry
        - can achieve tight tolerances
        - relatively expensive and time consuming process
3. **Molding**: very similar to casting, w/c involves shaping a liquid or pliable material using a mold.
  - Most of the times used for platics
    - **Injection Molding**: most commonly used manufacturing method for plastics
      - Polymer granules are fed into the hopper and a screw is used to pass the material through heated
        cylinder, before it is forced at pressure into the mold.
      - Mostly used for thermoplastics (molten when heated and hardened when cooled)
      - It is avery fast process
      - can be fully automated
      - high start-up costs due to the expensive molds
      - cost-effective for large production runs
    - **Compression Molding**: Movable upper mold and fixed lower mold
      - The mold is closed and pressure and temperature are applied.
      - Mostly used for thermosets (polymers irreversibly harden when heated)
      - Tooling costs are relatively cheap (low tooling costs)
      - realtively slow process (Good for small runs)
      - not well suited for complex designs.
    - **Blow Molding**: the forming of a hollow object by inflating or blowing a thermoplastic 
        molten tube called a “parison” in the shape of a mold cavity.
4. **Joining**: involves combining multiple separate components into a larger assembly
  - So far we have only looked at material deformation processes
  - Like machining, joining is a secondary process
  - The different types of joining processes are:
    - **Welding**: uses extremely high heat to fuse distinct metal parts together
    - **riveting**: a semi-permanent and non-thermal joining method that involves using 
      a mechanical fastener/rivet (a metallic part with a dome-shaped head) to join 
      sheet metal parts. Riveting involves drilling a hole in the two sheet metal 
      parts you want to join together and installing a rivet.
    - **brazing**: the base metal melts during welding.
      - Brazing is a process that joins two or more metal surfaces by letting molten metal 
        flow into the joint. The filler metal has a lower melting temperature than the parts 
        to be joined to keep the workpieces from melting. Although brazing is one of the 
        oldest joining methods, it is still used today for a good reason.
    - **Soldingv: the base metal melts during welding
      - Soldering is a process used for joining metal parts to form a mechanical or 
        electrical bond. It typically uses a low melting point metal alloy (solder) 
        which is melted and applied to the metal parts to be joined and this bonds to the 
        metal parts and forms a connection when the solder solidifies.
    - **Fastening**:temporary joining process that employs additional elements to 
      mechanically assemble or attach two or more parts together. Additional mechanical 
      elements that are used for fastening is called fasteners.However, threaded elements 
      like nut-bolt, screw, etc. are commonly considered as fasteners as it can provide 
      reliable and sound joint.
5. **Machining**: Involves using a tool to remove material from a larger object
  - Often used for secondary shaping, when the part has been already been formed using a primary 
    process like casting.
  - can be used fore a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics, and wood
    - **Turning**: the use of a cutting tool to shape a rotating working piece
    - **Drilling**: the cutting of a circular hole by pressing a rotating drill bit through a solid object
    - **Reaming**: Reaming is a finishing operation of high-precision holes performed with a 
        multi-edge tool. High surface finish, superb hole quality, and close dimensional 
        tolerance are achieved at high penetration rates and small depths of cut.
6. **Additive**: involves adding material to build up an object, typically one layer at a time
  - Examples of additive manufacturing are:
    - 3D Printing: a slow process and tha range of materials which can be used is limited
      - tends to be used for prototyping rather than for mass production
    - Laser Sintering
    - Vat Photopolymerization
    
### Drilling, Boring and Reaming Machining Operations
1. **Drilling Operation**:a metal cutting operation by rotating and pressing a multi-point cutting tool to 
    cut a circular round hole in a work-piece.
   - A multi-point cutting tool is known as a drilling bit.
   - Standard drill bits in various sizes are available in the market
   - Drilling machines are used to cut a straight hole in metals, plastic, wood, concrete wall, etc.
   - The selection of the type of drill pit depends on the workpiece material
   - During drilling, the bit rotates at a very high rpm.
2. **Boring Operation**: a metal cutting operation to enlarge existing hole diameter by 
    using a single point edge cutting tool.
   - Different from drilling operations because boring requires an existing hole.
   - Can be performed using drilling, boring, lathe, and milling machines
   - Tool rotating speed is kept relatively low during boring operations
   - Example of of boring operations include enlarging holes in casting parts
3. **Reaming Operation**: a cutting operation to enlarge the existing hole diameter to make it 
      more accurate and improve the surface finish.
   - The cutting tools used for reaming is known as **reamer**.
   - Reaming bit --> finishing existing hole
   - The reamer rotates at approximately half the RPM of the drilling operation during reaming.
   - Reaming is a finishing operation and does not cut significant material compared to drilling or boring.
### Summary
- **Drilling**:
  - Drilling New hole in workpiece
  - Utilizes a drill bit to create a new hole
  - Very high tool rotating speed
  - Drilled hole surface is not good
- **Boring**:
  - Enlarge existing hole
  - Use a single-point cutting tool to enlarge the existing hole
  - Low tool rotating speed
  - A boring hole has a surface finish better than drilled holes
- **Reaming**:
  - Finish existing hole
  - Utilizes Reamer tool to finish the existing hole
  - The Reamer tool rotates at a speed of approximately half of the drilling operation.
  - The reaming hole has a good surface finish.
