### 1. On-premises software
- On-premises software (abbreviated to on-prem, and incorrectly referred to as on-premise) is installed and runs on computers on the premises of the person or organization using the software, rather than at a remote facility such as a server farm or cloud. On-premises software is sometimes referred to as "shrinkwrap" software, and **off-premises software** is commonly called "software as a service" ("SaaS") or "cloud computing".
- The software consists of database and modules that are combined to particularly serve the unique needs of the large organizations regarding the automation of corporate-wide business system and its functions.
### 2. Edge Computing
- Edge computing is an emerging computing paradigm which refers to a range of networks and devices at or near the user. 
- Edge is about processing data closer to where it's being generated, enabling processing at greater speeds and volumes, leading to greater action-led results in real time.
### 3. Fog Computing
- Fog computing is defined as a decentralized infrastructure that places storage and processing components at the edge of the cloud, where data sources such as application users and sensors exist. 
### 4. Cloud Computing
- Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
- There are four main types of cloud computing: private clouds, public clouds, hybrid clouds, and multiclouds.
