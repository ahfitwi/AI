1. **Linear Regression**: based on a continuous variable
  - Cost of houses, number of calls, total sales
  - Establish the r/nship between independent and dependent variables by fitting the best line
  - The best-fit line is known as the regression line and is represented by a linear equation.
  $$Y = a\times X + b$$
  - In the above equation:
    - Y – Dependent Variable
    - a – Slope
    - X – Independent variable
    - b – Intercept
   - The coefficients a and b are derived based on minimizing the sum of the squared difference of distance between data points and the regression line.
   - **Linear Regression is mainly of two types**: **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression**. 
   - **Simple Linear Regression** is characterized by one independent variable. And, 
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**(as the name suggests) is characterized by multiple (more than 1) independent variables. 
   - While finding the best-fit line, you can fit a polynomial or curvilinear regression. And these are known as polynomial or curvilinear regression.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Classification Algo
  - It is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values ( Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on a given set of independent variable(s). 
  - In simple words, it predicts the probability of the occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. 
  - Since it predicts the probability, its output values lie between 0 and 1 (as expected).
