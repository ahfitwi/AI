# ML Applications
1. **Linear Regression**: based on a continuous variable
  - Cost of houses, number of calls, total sales
  - Establish the r/nship between independent and dependent variables by fitting the best line
  - The best-fit line is known as the regression line and is represented by a linear equation.
  $$Y = a\times X + b$$
  -v
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **SVM**
6. **Naive Bayes**
7. **kNN**
8. **K-Means**
9. **Random Forest**
10. **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms**
11. **Gradient Boosting Algorithms***
