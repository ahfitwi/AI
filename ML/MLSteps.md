# ML Comprises The Following Major steps

### 1. Data Collection
  - Collect/garner/gather/glean data applicable to your problem statement you are aspiing to solve using ML Model.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
  - Transform datasets into a form that can be accepted by the ML Models.
  - Scaling/downsampling, Imputation
  - Proprtional and Diversified Data to avoid biases (Alg, data, and societal)
      - If you use 10K images for can and 5K images for dog to create/build a model, it will be biased towards the cat.
  - Create Training, Evaluation, and Testing Sets
### 3. Model Selection
  - 
### 4. Model Training
  - 
### 5. Performance Evaluation
  - 
### 6. Performance/Hyperparameter Tunning

# Side Notes:
## Extrapolation:
  - refers to estimating an unknown value based on extending a known sequence of values or facts. To extrapolate is to infer something not explicitly stated from existing information. 
  - refers to predicting values that are outside of a range of data points.
## Interpolation:
  - refers to predicting values that are inside of a range of data points.
  - the act of estimating a value within two known values that exist within a sequence of values.
