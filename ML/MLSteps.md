# ML Comprises The Following Major steps
- ML allows the systems to make decisions autonomously without any external support.
- Decisions are made when the machine is able to learn from the data and understand the underlying patterns that are contained within it.
- Through pattern matching and further analysis, they return the outcome which can be a ***classification*** or a ***prediction/regression***.

### 1. Data Collection
  - Collect/garner/gather/glean data applicable to your problem statement you are aspiing to solve using ML Model.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
  - Transform datasets into a form that can be accepted by the ML Models.
  - Scaling/downsampling, Imputation
  - Proprtional and Diversified Data to avoid biases (Alg, data, and societal)
      - If you use 10K images for can and 5K images for dog to create/build a model, it will be biased towards the cat.
  - Create Training, Evaluation, and Testing Sets
### 3. Model Selection
  - Build or select a model that suites your situation
  - Possible Types of Models:
      1. **Supervised Learning**: when there is a precise mapping between input-output data.
        - Dataset, in this case, is labeled, meaning that the algorithm identifies the features explicitly and carries out predictions or classification accordingly.
        - As the training period progresses, the algorithm is able to identify the relationships between the variables/classes such that we can predict a new outcome.

            Input (datasets) + Annotations (tell what each input are) --> ML Model --> Prediction
        - Major Supervised Learning Models:
          - Classification: response is discrete and belongs to a set of classes. It takes labeled/annotated inputs.
            - Fraud Detection
            - Email Spam Detection
            - Diagnostics
            - Image Classification
          - Regression: response is continuous
            - Risk Assessment
            - Score Prediction
      2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
        - Dimensionality Reduction (SVD/PCA)
          - Text Mining
          - Face Recognition
          - Big Data Visualization
          - Image Recognition
        - Clustering
          - Biology
          - City Planning
          - Targeting Marketing
      4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Trial and Error
        - Gaming
        - Finance Sector
        - Manufacturing
        - Inventory Management
        - Robot Navigation
### 4. Model Training
  - 
### 5. Performance Evaluation
  - 
### 6. Performance/Hyperparameter Tunning

# Side Notes:
## Extrapolation:
  - refers to estimating an unknown value based on extending a known sequence of values or facts. To extrapolate is to infer something not explicitly stated from existing information. 
  - refers to predicting values that are outside of a range of data points.
## Interpolation:
  - refers to predicting values that are inside of a range of data points.
  - the act of estimating a value within two known values that exist within a sequence of values.
