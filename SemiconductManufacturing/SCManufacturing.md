# Semiconductor Manufacturing Process
- Constantly evolving in the enormous SC ecosystem
- Si is the main material of SC
- There are 8 essential SC manufacturing process
- To be usable, the Si goes through the following SC manufacturing process

1. **Wafer Manufacturing**: make wafer from sands
  - SCs are stacked high and solid to form a complex structure similar to a high-rising building. 
  - Constructing a building starts with the foundation. A wafer is the foundation for the SC. 
  - Wafers are made from silicon extracted from sand.
  - First, sand is heated until it melts into a high purity liquid, and then gets solidified by crystallization.
  - The resultant silicon rod is called an ingot (Silicone pillar).
  - These ingots are sliced into a disc thinly sliced wafers.
  - The surface of sliced wafers is rough and contains defects.
  - So, polishing machines are used to polish the surface of a wafer
  - The defects on the surface could negatively affect the precision of the circuits.
  - Samsung Electronics is ranked 1st in the world in SC.
  
2. **Oxidation**: make SC conductors
  - Oxygen or water vapor is sprayed on the wafer surface to form a uniform oxide film.
  - It protects the surface of the wafer
  - Insulating layer that blocks leakage of current between circuits.
  - Now the foundation is ready: wafer --> Oxide Film
  
3. **Photolithography**: Creating circuit blue print on the wafer.
  - The buildingup process begins here.
  - Just as you draw a blueprints to build a building, you draw a circuit design onto a wafer.
  - It is called the photolithography process
  - It is called "photo" for short b/c it is similar to developing a photo taken on a film camera.
  - With SC, a photomask (a glass substrate with a computer-designed ckt pattern) functions as the film.
  - wafer --> Oxide Film --> Photoresist
  - In order to draw the circuit on the wafer, the photoresist, a material that responds to the light, 
     is applied thinly and evenly on the oxide film previously placed on the wafer.
  - Now, when light transfers the patterned photomask, the ckt is drawn on the wafer surface.
  - Just like developing a photo, a ckt pattern is imprinted on the wafer by spraying developer fluid
    and removing from the areas exposed to light.
  - After an inspection of the wafer to check whether the pattern is drawn well, it moves onto the next step.
  
4. **Etching**: Curving out of unnecessary materials.
  - Unnecessary materials are whittled away or curved out so that only the designed pattern remains.
  - Using a liquid or gas itching, unnecessary materials are selectively removed to draw the desired design.
  - When checmical solutions are used for etching, it is called **wet etching**
  - When gas or plasma is used for etching, it is called **dry etching**
  
5. **Deposition & Ion Implantation**:
  - Photolithographic and etching processes are repeated several times on the wafer, layer by layer
  - Here, an insulating film that separates and protects the stacked ckt is required.
  - It is called a thin-film. wafer --> Oxide Film --> Photoresist --> Thin-film
  - Coating the thin-film at the desired molecular or atomic level onto a wafer is called **vapor deposition**
  - Precise and sophisticated technology is required to uniformly apply the thin-film on the wafer.
  - To give the SC electrical characteristics, ion implementation is also required.
  - A SC made of silicon doesn't conduct electricity
  - Only Adding impurities make conduct current and has conductive properties.
  - In summary, through the wafer manufacturing, Oxidation, Photolithography, Etching, Deposition, 
    and Ion Implantation processes, the wafer becomes conductive and numerous ckts drawn on it.
  
6. **Metal Wiring**: Electrical signalling
  - In order for this ckt to work, an electrical signal must be applied.
  - It is necessary to create a path for electricity to pass through according to the ckt pattern.
  - It is a process that allows electricity to flow by depositing a thin metal film using materials
    such as aluminum, titaium, or tungsten so that electricity can pass through the SC well.
  - The chip manufacturing processes are now coming toward completion
14. **Electrical Die Sorting (EDS)**:
  - The process of testing electrical characteristics to make sure each individual chip has 
    reached the desired quality level.
  - This is the process of testing to ensure flawless SC chips.
  - Inother words, it is a testing step to sort out defective chips
  - Yield is a percentage of prime chips relative to the maximum chip count on a single wafer.
  $$Yield = \frac{Number of working chips}{Max number of designed chips}\times 100$$
