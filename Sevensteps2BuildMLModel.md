# ML Model Building Steps
- AI <-- ML <-- DL
- AI is not a one-size-fits-all technology
- AI is new and daunting to many
- Many have established methodologies that help ensure success
### Program
- [Input] --> [Processing: Constants & Vars] --> [Output]  Linear
### AI
- [Input] --> [Processing: Constants, Vars, InfoLearnt] <--> [Program] --> [Learnt Data]  Complex
## Steps To Build ML MOdel:
1. **Understand & Identify The Business Problem (Business Context)**:
  - Understand and identify the business problem and define success
  - Get a firm grasp of the business project's objectives and requirements
  - set specific quantifiable goals.
  - Include ML metrics and business KPIs in calculating your estimated ROI from the project.
2. **Understand & Identify Data**:
  - An ML model is built by learning from training data, and then applying that knowledge to make accurate prediction from new data.
  - Identifying data needs, the quantity, quality and type is critical.
  - Knowing how your model will operate on real world data offline or in real time, for example, will also play into the kind of data you need, collect.
3. **Collect and Prepare Data**: It includes the following tasks
  - Data Collection
  - Cleansing
  - Aggregation
  - Labeling
  - Annotation
  - Transformation
4. **Determine The Model's Features, and Train The Model**: It includes the ff
  - **Model Technique Selection**
  - **Training**
  - **Hyperparameter Tunning and Setting**
  - **Validation**
  - **Development & Testing**
  - **Algorithm Selection**
  - **Model Optimization**
5. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
  - Evaluation is the QA of ML
  - Adequately evaluating model performance against metrics your requirements determines how the model will work in the real-world.
  - Evaluation includes the ff to meet the est business goals
    - **Model Metric Evaluation**
    - **COnfusion Matrix Calculations**
    - **KPIs**
    - **Model Performance Metrics**
    - **Model Quality Measurements**
    - **Final Determination**
7. **Model Deployment (Experiment and Adjust The Model in Operation)**:
  - See how the model works in a real world, or operationalizeng
  - Deployment Scenarios:
    - On premise or closed environemnt
    - On Edge environemnt
    - On Fog environemnt
    - On Cloud environemnt
8. **Repeat The Process and Make Improvement**:
  - Iteratively improve the model
  - Identify what has worked well and what hasn't worked well
  - Make improvements iteratively
