# Inudstry 4.0
- During the Covid19 pandemic, we have seen how important the digital technologies are important parts of our lives.
  - We have seen online shopping, teaching, video conferencing, virtual exhibitions, online paying, ...
- Industry 4.0 --> 2011 --> Germany, 
- Formally introduced by former chairman of world economic forum, Mr. Klause Schwab, in 2015
### What is Industrial Revolution?
- Defined as the major changes and transition in manufacturing and industrial process with new innovative technologies.
- Industrial Revolution 1.0: 1784 Machine powered by water and steam
- Industrial Revolution 2.0: 1870 Electricity and Heat followd by mass production (train, cars, aeroplanes)
- Industrial Revolution 3.0: 1969 Electronics, Automation, and Computers. More automated, controlled using PLCs
  - Focused on digital technologies on industrial processes automations
- Industrial Revolution 4.0: 2015 to present, triggered by the concept of cyber-physical systems.
  - Connects real-world with virtual world.
### What is Industry 4.0?
- Connects machines and systems inside factories
  - Machines can think and communicate also. If one machine stops working, it can inform others.
  - ATS is an example, when utility power goes off, the generator starts running.
- Factories are interconnected one another. 
  - If one factory stops/breaks down, it can inform other factories to start.
- Systems and machines in factories can be accessed from remote location using mobile apps.
  - For maintenance, updating and patching softwares, controlling, ...
- Tracking of every system is possible using unique identification and Internet Connectivity.
- Drones can facilitate access to remote systems difficult to acess via Internet.
- It is a new phase of in the IR that introduce intelligent networking of machines and processes for industry
  with the help of information and communication technology."
- It connects physical world with digital world.
### What are the key technologies in industry 4.0?
- **Internet of Things (IoTs)**
  - It is a network of physical objects, that are able to collect data with the help 
      of sensors and exchange data each other with the help of internet.
  - In factories, IoTs will allow  field devices to communicate and inetract each other 
      with less human interaction/intervention.
- **Advanced Robotics**
  - Robots are programmerable machines that are usually able to carry out a series of actions autonomously, 
    or semi-autonomously
  - Robotics is abranch of technology that deals with physical robots.
  - In advanced robotics, robots can inetract with one another and work safely side by side with humans and 
      learn from humans. 
  - In the future, it seems like there would be more Human-Robot collaborations and many workers will be 
      replaced by robots
- **Arificial Learning**
  - AI is a computer program which enables a machine to simulate human behavior like learning, 
      planning, reasoning, knowledge sharing, problem solving etc.
  - An application AI for manufacturing is ML, which allows machine to automatically learn from past data
      to produce accurate output or generate alert about an abnormal output.
  - Confusion between Robotics and AI: 
    - Robitcs is a programmed physical system for a specific task
    - AI is a program that simulates behavior associated with human intelligence
    - But by combining AI and robotics, you can make a robot that stimulate human intelligence.
    - That is, AI can help create an Intelligent Robot.
- **Cloud Computing**
  - Use of remote servers to store, manage, & process data which can be accessed through the Internet on demand
      from any where in the world as long as one has access to the Internet.
  - The process of storing data from various electronic devices (Desktops, Mobiles, Tablets, Camera, ...)
    in a remote server/servers and you can access your data from anywhere in the world as long as you
    have access to the Internet.
  - Gmail cloud is a common example.
  - Other examples:
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
      - the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, 
      - offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.
    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) --> a suite of cloud computing services
    - Microsoft Azure Cloud Services
      - Azure is Microsoft's public cloud platform. Azure offers a large collection of services, 
      - which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and 
      - managed database service capabilities
    - IBM Cloud
      - BM Cloud, (formerly known as Bluemix) is a set of cloud computing services for 
      - business offered by the information technology company IBM.
    - Salesforce Cloud
    - ZOHO Cloud
- **Big Data & Analytics**
  - Huge data continuously received from various devices is what we call Big Data. 
  - It can be Images, Voices, Video, Text, Numerical, ...
  - Big Data Analytics is the process of storing and examining large volume of data from various 
      sources and systematically extract useful information from that.
- **Cyber Security**
  - All systems are connected together and are called cyber-physical systems. 
  - The practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data 
    from malicious attacks.
- **Additive Manufacturing**
  - It is a computer controlled process that creates 3D objects by depositing materials, usually in layers.
  - AKA, 3D Printing
- **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality(VR)**
  - AR is a technology that creates an enhanced version of the real world infront of you by adding 
    (superimposing) a layer of digital information on that.
  - In AR, a digital information os superimposed over a naturally existing environment.
  - VR is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment, like virtually visiting 
    or walking on the moon.
  - AR vs VR: They two different technologies.
    - AR is computer generated graphics on top of actual reality.
    - VR is computer generated graphics to create a virtual world (alternative reality)

### Benefits of Implementing Industry 4.0
- Productivity and Efficiency
- Cost Optimization
- New Opportunities
- Customer Satisfaction
- Safety

### Famous Quote of Klause
- In the world, it is not the big fish which eats the small fish, it is the fast fish which eats the slow fish.
    Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum
